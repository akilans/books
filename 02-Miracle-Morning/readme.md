### This Book Builds Three Imperative Arguments:

* You are just as worthy, deserving, and capable of creating and
sustaining extraordinary health, wealth, happiness, love, and
success in your life, as any other person on earth. It is absolutely
crucial—not only for the quality of your life, but for the impact
you make on your family, friends, clients, co-workers, children,
community, and anyone whose life you touch—that you start
living in alignment with that truth.

* In order for you to stop settling for less than you deserve—in any
area of your life—and to create the levels of personal,
professional, and financial success you desire, you must first
dedicate time each day to becoming the person you need to be, one
who is qualified and capable of consistently attracting, creating,
and sustaining the levels of success you want.

* How you wake up each day and your morning routine (or lack thereof) dramatically affects your levels of success in every single
area of your life. Focused, productive, successful mornings
generate focused, productive, successful days—which inevitably
create a successful life—in the same way that unfocused,
unproductive, and mediocre mornings generate unfocused,
unproductive, and mediocre days, and ultimately a mediocre
quality of life. By simply changing the way you wake up in the
morning, you can transform any area of your life, faster than you
ever thought possible.
